RefTagger
========
RefTagger tags Bible references entered as text to links with a tooltip that 
shows short Bible quotes, sharing links, and a link to open the full text. 
Styling, default versions, settings and exclusions are all configurable in 
admin.

RefTagger supports a wide variety of English Bible translations as well as 
translations in Arabic, Czech, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, 
Russian and Spanish. While the default translation is set in the admin screen,
individual references can be overridden within the text; see the wiki for more 
information.

The RefTagger service is provided by [Faithlife](https://faithlife.com/products/reftagger?ref=backdropcms) 
and includes optional integration with their [Logos Bible Software](https://www.logos.com/?ref=backdropcms).
